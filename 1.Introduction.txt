NodeJS is an environment to run JavaScript outside browser.
It's built on top of chrome's v8 engine (engine is a tool that  converts our code to the machine code and every browser 
has an engine)

//difference between browser js and node js

browser js:
-

node js:
- no access to browser api (dom, fetch)
- no window object access
- used for building server side apps
- unlike browser we can access file system in the node(fs module), info about os(os module) respond to network requests <=
(these or some of the things we can do in node)
- versions (eg. if there's a new version sometime it won't support the older things, but, in node version is not a problem)
- access to modules by default(in browser access to modules are optional). It's hard to imagine a node app where we are not 
going to use them. NodeJs uses common js library for the modules.
